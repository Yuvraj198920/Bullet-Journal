## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Bug #1: Rescheduling Task Options Not Showing ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
When users tried to reschedule a task, they didn't get any date selection options. The "Schedule" menu item just changed the state without allowing date selection.

**Solution:**
Created a new `RescheduleDialog` component that provides a calendar interface for selecting a new date. Updated `BulletEntry` component to use this dialog for both tasks and events.

**Changes Made:**
- Created `/components/RescheduleDialog.tsx` - New dialog component with calendar picker
- Updated `/components/BulletEntry.tsx`:
  - Added state management for reschedule dialogs
  - Replaced inline schedule action with dialog trigger
  - Added `handleReschedule` and `handleEventReschedule` functions
  - Render two dialog instances (one for tasks, one for events)

**User Experience:**
- Click "Schedule for Different Date" ‚Üí Calendar picker opens
- Select a date ‚Üí Task is rescheduled with migration count incremented
- Visual preview of selected date before confirming

### Bug #2: Previously Created Tasks Not Showing After Login ‚úÖ FIXED

**Problem:**
After logging in, users couldn't see their previously created tasks and entries. The data wasn't being loaded from localStorage.

**Root Cause:**
The `handleSignUp` function didn't automatically log in users after successful registration, so user data wasn't loaded.

**Solution:**
Modified the `handleSignUp` function to automatically sign in the user after successful signup, which triggers the `loadUserData` function.

**Changes Made:**
- Updated `/App.tsx` `handleSignUp` function:
  - After `signUp()`, now calls `signIn()` with the same credentials
  - Sets user and access token
  - Loads user data from localStorage

**User Experience:**
- Sign up ‚Üí Automatically logged in ‚Üí Data immediately available
- Sign in ‚Üí Existing data loads correctly from localStorage
